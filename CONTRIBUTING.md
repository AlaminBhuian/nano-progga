##Directions for Developers
**package:** nano progga

The theme provided LESS compiled and minified CSS, and minified JS files to ensure site speed. Compiled CSS file is (in root directory):

* `style.css`

and minified JavaScripts file is in `js/` directory:

* `nano-progga.min.js`

The main resources are available in `__development/original-resources/` directory

To make any edit for further fixes or development, depending on your LESS and/or JS compiler, you *may need* to copy the `style.LESS` and `nano-progga.js` file to the respective directories to compile and overwrite the existing `style.css` and/or `nano-progga.min.js`.

If you don't want to use any auto compiler, you can make changes to the original LESS file and JS files and then using any Online compiler you can get a compiled and minified version of the code and can manually overwrite the `.css` and `.min.js` files by yourself.
