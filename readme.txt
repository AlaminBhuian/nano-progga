== LICENSES ==

	__CODE LICENSE__
	I always respect my first WordPress theme teacher Ian Stewart (http://themeshaper.com/author/superuser/) for his excellent brief on my first theme. I then tried many and learn more with the help of WordPress developers at http://wordpress.stackexchange.com. But with their assistance and guidance, the theme was completely developed by nanodesigns

	__DESIGN LICENSE__
	The layout design was totally made by nanodesigns. The license for the design is as same as the theme itself.

	__FONT LICENSE__
	The nano progga theme used two fonts for the layout: (1) Siyam Rupali, and (2) Font Awesome for icon fonts. The fonts are embeded with the theme so that they will not be loaded from any third party resources.
 		• Siyam Rupali is an Open Source Font available in Github.com (https://github.com/potasiyam/Siyam-Rupali‎)
 		• Icon font is designed using fontastic.me

== INSTALLATION ==
	
	1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
