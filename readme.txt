I will always respect my first WordPress theme teacher Ian Stewart (http://themeshaper.com/author/superuser/) for his excellent brief on my first theme. I then tried many and learn more with the help of WordPress developers at wordpress.stackexchange.com. But with their assistance and guidance, the theme was completely developed by nanodesigns

The layout design was totally made by nanodesigns. The license for the design is as same as the theme itself.
