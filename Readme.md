##LICENSES##

###CODE LICENSE###
I will always respect my first WordPress theme teacher Ian Stewart (http://themeshaper.com/author/superuser/) for his excellent brief on my first theme. I then tried many and learn more with the help of WordPress developers at http://wordpress.stackexchange.com. But with their assistance and guidance, the theme was completely developed by nanodesigns

###DESIGN LICENSE###
The layout design was totally made by nanodesigns. The license for the design is as same as the theme itself.

###FONT LICENSE###
The nano progga theme used two fonts for the layout: (1) Siyam Rupali, and (2) Font Awesome for icon fonts. The fonts are embeded with the theme so that they will not be loaded from any third party resources.
 • Siyam Rupali is an Open Source Font available in Github.com(https://github.com/potasiyam/Siyam-Rupali‎)
 • Font Awesome is another Open Source Icon Font available in Github.com (http://fontawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome)


##CREDITS##
All the credits goes to the God - ALLAH, the most benevolent, the most forgiving. Thanks to Ian Stewart, my theme guru. And obviously my thanks goes to the developers and mentors at http://wordpress.stackexchange.com community. Thanks to my wife Hafsa Islam for her support even I's busy with this theme development for so long period. :) (Thanks Hafsa! I love you.)


##CONCLUSION##
Let's use nano progga and take Bengali (<em>Bānglā</em>) blogging one step further.
